### 👨‍💻 Why I Made This App
---
This Project was previously made by me in Node-Express-Ejs Stack, but as I Learned more about MERN Stack I couldn't resist to rebuild this application into a MERN Stack verison.<br/>

Here are the reasons I converted it into a MERN Stack Application.

- To Revise the Concept of MERN and REST API
- To make overall app Faster than before.
- To make the app more User Friendly
